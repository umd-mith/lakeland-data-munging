But many items both on the 94287b video and described in the 556391 notes are NOT on the jump drive.

SS: One batch of 78 initial items (from the rephotography tent station) was fully cropped/corrected on the day of the event, but it appears to be only a subsection of the items from this folder. These were jpeg files. I found another folder labeled 037d64 under 'Miscellaneous Ephemera' with 20 raw files which were then converted to Jpegs. Having trouble determining from the Accession notes if these additional 20 images have been mislabeled with the wrong folder--I did not process these, and I'm not clear on why they're segregated from the other 78 images. The fact that they're raw files indicates that they were taken at the end of the second day, which is when we figured out how to change the Nikon settings to capture raw instead of jpegs.",
