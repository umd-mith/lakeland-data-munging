      "Accession Notes": "Lakeland High School Flyer Trip Announcement, October 12, 1990 held at St. Joseph's Catholic Church. Scholarship offered by the last class to provide funds to Fairmont Heights students in honor of principal, Edgar A. Smith. Each season they hosted a fundraising event (Sparrows beach in summer, dance/festival in Glenarden in the fall, Atlantic City trips); James Chittmans designed the flyer; Vera Johnson and Bell Wright acted as organizers. \n\nLakeland High School Reunion Trip Flyer to Las Vegas in 1991. The class flew from BWI airport and stopped in Missouri to see the Gateway Arches. More than 100 individuals attended, including spouses and children; many of the classmate's families sponsored their trip. They toured Gladys Knights' home and the home of Sanford & Son, and gambling and a helicopter rides. The whole class had a hand in organizing the trip. \n\nEdgar A. Smith Scholarship document; typed on a typewriter; scholarship established before invention of computers. The scholarship was organized by Lakeland High school last class, but they wanted to include other schools. They traveled to Upper Marlboro Legal Library to research and structure the scholarship, eventually getting it incorporated. Each year, the committee reviewed applications with the goal to distribute $2,000 to high school students for college costs; recipients were from the towns of Fairmont Heights, Bowie, Laurel, and Muirkirk. School desegregation impacted the group of recipients. \n\nEdgar A. Smith Scholarship Application used to vet applications. Individuals from the last class served on sub-committees for the creation of application and to reviewers of applications. \n\n\"Jake\" Sterling Queen was the individual driving force and organizer for the Edgar A. Smith Scholarship. He became Mrs. Bettye Queen's wife and had younger sisters who attended Fairmont Heights. \n\nEvaluation for Screening Scholarship Applicants. Requests information on test scores, community involvement. Mr. Dock says many students were most involved in local churches (many from First Baptist Church in Glenarden). First Baptist Church of Glenarden was heavily involved in student programming. After 1950, the County reorganized the curriculum to stress business and vocational skills (shorthand, typing, bookkeeping, brick laying, carpeting). Lakeland High School Class of 1950 and Frederick Douglass HS had the first 12th grade classes in the County; prior to that students graduated in 11th grade. Central Avenue served as dividing line. One scholarship recipient became a Pharmacist after graduating from Howard University School of Pharmacy; One went into nursing, one pursued ministry, some became teachers in Prince George's, Howard County, or Baltimore City. Many males went into the Air Force.  ",

Donor's mother Gladys Lillian Haliburton(nee Essex), of Essex VA, is standing third from left. Everyone in the photo is in the Essex family. Gladys moved to Lakeland with her son, Lowell (donor), in 1944.\nOn following pages are various ephemera - sympathy cards, saved notes, thank you cards, etc. Donor's paternal grandmother's photo is on one page with various sympathy cards, and an obituary. On following pages are ephemera from a friend's wedding - cards, a kerchief, etc. \nThere are also song lyrics typed out, mostly of a religious nature. Donor went to Fermont Heights Highschool and graduated in '58. Donor's father's things. He is from WV.\nAnother wedding invitation - Bernice and Leonard Ruston - Gladys' friend, maiden name Bernice Thomas. Mary Weems' (a family friend) name appears on another card. Donor says that in the 50s, everybody in Lakeland was friends - you could \"leave the doors open and walk right in!\" \nGladys went to 1st Baptist Church and took donor to church as well - he did not like the pastor. Pastor, Dr. Covington, disrespected a member of the Weems family who was a caretaker of the church - pastor wouldn't accept his body upon his death (to be buried?). \nNext few pages are various newspaper clippings of happenings and members within the Lakeland community. \nEric Thomas, pictured in a newspaper clipping, is donor's nephew. He played football for Parkdale in the 60s/70s. \nJoanne Braxton, mentioned in another clipping, is Ms. Weems' cousin. Gladys was involved in organizing Lakeland community events.

Donor lived on Navahoe and built a house in around '66 on the same street. Tonia went to Frederick Douglass HS.\n\nItem 2: Magazine for Gladys Hilburton - \"The Plain Truth,\" from October 1986.

Quarterly meetings listed for follow-ups/recap of trips; to add an item to the meeting agenda, classmates called Jake Queen or the President. \n\nLetterhead from Lakeland High School. Rodney Young designed the letterhead and wanted to \"keep it simple.\" The lamp of knowledge served as a symbol for the last class. \n\nMeeting Minutes from Dec 17, 1999; penned in Mrs. Bettye Queen's penmanship. \"Whatever she did she did well, she was a great leader.\" Agenda items include treasurer report  and scholarship report. Lists January 8 as 50th year in ministry; church on Wheeler Road. More than half the class went to a hotel in Oxen Hill to celebrate. Dues were collected from classmates to fund activities; advertisements were also placed in local newspapers to promote the last class' activities. Glenarden, Laurel, and Lakeland all had strong American Legion chapters and were avid advertising partnership. Lakeland Hall on Rhode Island Ave. housed Lakeland's American Legion Chapter and the House of Ruth, a religious organization. They used to hold poetry recitals for youth, because \"poetry makes you think.\" Spiritual hymns were also vital.",

The Board agreed with the understanding that the delegation should select the site. This was to be a community effort, i.e., the high school was to serve the communities of Bladensburg,\nBrentwood, North Brentwood, Lakeland, Ammendale, Murkirk and Laurel. Lakeland had been chosen as the location, because of its central location. The Board of Education was to advance the funds for the purchase of the land and members of the communities were to repay the advance gradually, over a period of years. Money from the Rosenwald fund would pay for the construction of the building. Accordingly, early in 1928, the Board advanced the money for several lots in Block 14 (just west of the B&O railroad tracks) and a committee of representatives of the communities-chaired by J. W.C. Mack of Lakeland--was appointed to oversee the project until the building was completed and occupied.\n\nThe Lakeland High School opened in the fall of 1928, with two teachers and 45 students in grades 8 and 9. In July of 1929, W. J. Conway, chairman of the Lakeland High School P.T.A., presented to the Board of Education the balance of the obligation of $1600, which the communities had agreed to raise. On the 29 of July 1929, the Board instructed that \"the\ncommunity be assured of the Board's Appreciation of this evidence of splendid cooperation.\"\n\nLakeland was one of the first high schools established for Blacks in Prince George's County and. is therefore very significant in the history of Black education. Over the years, the building served also as a junior high (after larger high schools had been opened), as a local elementary school, as a Special Education Center and most recently (in 1983) has been converted into a Korean Catholic Mission.",
